In its inaugural year, I led the club in coordinating workshops, lab tours, and presentations to provide tools to help undergraduates get involved in research. My work on BioExplore was recognized with a Mary Gates Leadership Scholarship.
Website Poster Bioengineering Journal Club I launched the Bioengineering Journal Club (BJC) to provide an inclusive venue for University of Washington students to learn about and share their passions for cutting-edge research in bioengineering.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://parkersruth.com/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/projects/</guid><description>Mobile Heart Monitor As a final project for CSE 474, I built a mobile heart monitor prototype made from commodity hardware components. The electrocardiogram (ECG) measured from the fingers placed on two metal electrodes is displayed on a touchscreen. The P wave and QRS complex are detected and annotated in real-time. ECG abnormalities are identified and interpreted as potential heart maladies such as arrhythmia, premature ventricular contraction, and heart block.</description></item><item><title>Research</title><link>https://parkersruth.com/research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/research/</guid><description>Mobile Health systems Mobile Ultrasonic Sonar Exercise Sensing Physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for death worldwide, and yet eighty percent of US adults do not meet national exercise recommendations. In collaboration with the Sports Institute at UW Medicine, the UbiComp Lab is designing a smartphone application that can be prescribed to patients at University of Washington Medicine clinics. We believe that physical activity is a vital sign that should be monitored closely alongside blood pressure and BMI.</description></item><item><title>Teaching</title><link>https://parkersruth.com/teaching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/teaching/</guid><description>Instruction Ubiquitous Computing Seminar During the 2019â€“2020 academic year I led the CSE 590 U ubiquitous computing research seminar, which met weekly to discuss academic papers in interaction techniques, wearables, novel sensing, and pervasive computing.
MATLAB Seminar In Autumn 2019 I co-instructed the BIOEN 217 MATLAB Fundamentals for Bioengineers seminar, which introduces programming in MATLAB to students from a variety of backgrounds. I developed biomedically relevant examples, prepared and delivered lectures, graded coding assignments, and supported course development.</description></item></channel></rss>
