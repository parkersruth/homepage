&lt;p>I launched BioExplore as an initiative to increase support for University of Washington students interested in bioengineering-related research. In its inaugural year, I led the club in coordinating workshops, lab tours, and presentations to provide tools to help undergraduates get involved in research. My work on BioExplore was recognized with a Mary Gates Leadership Scholarship.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Research</title><link>https://parkersruth.com/research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/research/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="mobile-health-systems">Mobile Health systems&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for death worldwide, and yet eighty percent of US adults do not meet national exercise recommendations. In collaboration with the &lt;a href="https://thesportsinstitute.com/">Sports Institute at UW Medicine&lt;/a>, the UbiComp Lab is designing a smartphone application that can be prescribed to patients at University of Washington Medicine clinics. Physical activity is a vital sign that should be monitored regularly alongside blood pressure and BMI. Our application is designed to assist in goal setting, provide context-aware nudges, and connect exercise data with health care providers. To extend the quantification of physical activity beyond step counting, I evaluated the use of acoustic sonar sensing to classify a wide range of exercises. I mentored two high school interns who are assisted with data collection and analysis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Teaching</title><link>https://parkersruth.com/teaching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkersruth.com/teaching/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="course-instruction">Course Instruction&lt;/h1>
&lt;h3 id="ubiquitous-computing-seminar">Ubiquitous Computing Seminar&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>During the 2019â€“2020 academic year I led the CSE 590 U ubiquitous computing research seminar, which met weekly to discuss academic papers in interaction techniques, wearables, novel sensing, and pervasive computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="matlab-seminar">MATLAB Seminar&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Autumn 2019 I co-instructed the BIOEN 217 MATLAB Fundamentals for Bioengineers seminar, which introduces programming in MATLAB to students from a variety of backgrounds. I developed biomedically relevant examples, prepared and delivered lectures, graded coding assignments, and supported course development.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
