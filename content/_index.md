I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My research lies in the intersection of computing, engineering, and medicine. I am fortunate to be advised by [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/) and collaborate with [Scott Delp](https://nmbl.stanford.edu/people/scott-delp/) in biomechanics and [Emily Fox](https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/emily-b-fox) in statistics.

I earned  undergraduate degrees in computer engineering and bioengineering from the University of Washington in Seattle. As a member of the [UbiComp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) advised by [Dr. Shwetak Patel](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/members/), I explored applications of computing tools to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, including mobile health, wearables, and population health.
