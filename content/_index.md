I am a Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My research lies in the intersection of computing, engineering, and medicine. I am fortunate to be advised by [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/) and collaborate with [Scott Delp](https://nmbl.stanford.edu/people/scott-delp/) in biomechanics, [Emily Fox](https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/emily-b-fox) in statistics, and [Todd Coleman](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/todd-coleman) in bioengineering, and [Alison Marsden](https://cbcl.stanford.edu/people/alison-marsden) in pediatric cardiology.

I earned  undergraduate degrees in computer engineering and bioengineering from the University of Washington in Seattle. As a member of the [UbiComp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) advised by [Dr. Shwetak Patel](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/members/), I explored applications of computing tools to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, including mobile health, wearables, and population health.

Physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for death worldwide, and yet eighty percent of US adults do not meet national exercise recommendations. In collaboration with the [Sports Institute at UW Medicine](https://thesportsinstitute.com/), the UbiComp Lab is designing a smartphone application that can be prescribed to patients at University of Washington Medicine clinics. Physical activity is a vital sign that should be monitored regularly alongside blood pressure and BMI. Our application is designed to assist in goal setting, provide context-aware nudges, and connect exercise data with health care providers. To extend the quantification of physical activity beyond step counting, I evaluated the use of acoustic sonar sensing to classify a wide range of exercises. I mentored two high school interns who are assisted with data collection and analysis.
