I'm a Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University. My research lies in the intersection of computing, engineering, and medicine. I'm currently designing sensors and algorithms to measure digital biomarkers. I am fortunate to be advised by [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/) and collaborate with [Scott Delp](https://nmbl.stanford.edu/people/scott-delp/) in biomechanics, [Todd Coleman](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/todd-coleman) in bioengineering, [Alison Marsden](https://cbcl.stanford.edu/people/alison-marsden) in pediatric cardiology, [Jeremy Dahl](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/jeremy-dahl) in radiology, and [Emily Fox](https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/emily-b-fox) in statistics.

I earned undergraduate degrees in bioengineering and computer engineering from the University of Washington in Seattle. As a member of the UbiComp Lab advised by [Dr. Shwetak Patel](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/members/), I explored applications of computing tools to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, including mobile health, wearables, and population health.

I'm honored to be named an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, Hertz Fellowship Finalist, and Goldwater Scholar.

I will graduate with my PhD in 2027.
