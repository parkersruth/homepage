I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My research lies in the intersection of computing, engineering, and medicine.

I earned  undergraduate degrees in computer engineering and bioengineering from the University of Washington in Seattle. As a member of the [UbiComp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) advised by [Dr. Shwetak Patel](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/members/), I explored applications of computing tools to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, including mobile health, wearables, and population health.

<!-- Outside of my research, I enjoy Bossa Nova, languages, kürtőskalács, juggling, and whistling to myself. I hold a 2nd dan black belt in Tae Kwon Do. -->
