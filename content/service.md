I launched BioExplore as an initiative to increase support for University of Washington students interested in bioengineering-related research. In its inaugural year, I led the club in coordinating workshops, lab tours, and presentations to provide tools to help undergraduates get involved in research. My work on BioExplore was recognized with a Mary Gates Leadership Scholarship.

## Bioengineering Journal Club

I launched the Bioengineering Journal Club (BJC) to provide an inclusive venue for University of Washington students to learn about and share their passions for cutting-edge research in bioengineering. Topics included rapid diagnostic tests, biomaterials, nanoengineering, and drug delivery. We held biweekly meetings in which researchers described their work and presented a paper for discussion. In collaboration with faculty and advisors, BJC was re-envisioned as BioExplore after a successful pilot year.
