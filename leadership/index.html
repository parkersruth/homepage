' class=right draggable=false><p>I launched BioExplore as an initiative to increase support for University of Washington students interested in bioengineering-related research. In its inaugural year, I led the club in coordinating workshops, lab tours, and presentations to provide tools to help undergraduates get involved in research. My work on BioExplore was recognized with a Mary Gates Leadership Scholarship.</p><p><a class=button target=_blank href=https://sites.bioe.uw.edu/bioexplore>Website</a>

' class=right height=150px draggable=false><p>I launched the Bioengineering Journal Club (BJC) to provide an inclusive venue for University of Washington students to learn about and share their passions for cutting-edge research in bioengineering. Topics included rapid diagnostic tests, biomaterials, nanoengineering, and drug delivery. We held biweekly meetings in which researchers described their work and presented a paper for discussion. In collaboration with faculty and advisors, BJC was re-envisioned as BioExplore after a successful pilot year.</p><h1 id=pacific-northwest-brain-bee>Pacific Northwest Brain Bee</h1><p>The International Brain Bee was founded in 1998 by Dr. Norbert Myslinski at
the University of Maryland with the mission of inspiring generations of
young students to pursue studies in neuroscience and related fields.
The Pacific Northwest Brain Bee is a local chapter competition open to
students in grades 9-12 from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. After taking
first place in the Pacific Northwest Brain Bee, I built a webpage for the
competition and returned in 2017 and 2018 as a volunteer, encouraging
students to learn about neuroscience in high school.</p></main><footer>&copy; 2022 Parker Ruth<br></footer></body></html>
