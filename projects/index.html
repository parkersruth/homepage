made from commodity hardware components. The electrocardiogram (ECG)
measured from the fingers placed on two metal electrodes is displayed on a
touchscreen. The P wave and QRS complex are detected and annotated in
real-time. ECG abnormalities are identified and interpreted as potential
heart maladies such as arrhythmia, premature ventricular contraction,
and heart block. After a 30-second measurement, the user can review the
trace and cardiac health summary. The device also connects over Bluetooth to
a smartphone using standard GATT transactions. For this project I
implemented a custom IIR filter in C++ to perform real-time signal
processing and event detection, interfaced with peripherals through the SPI
protocol, and built event-based control flow for user interaction.</p><a class=button target=_blank href=/docs/ecg_monitor.pdf>Report</a><h1 id=apple-messages-analytics-toolbox>Apple Messages Analytics Toolbox</h1><img src=/img/amat.jpg alt="

" class=inline draggable=false><p>The Apple Messages Analytics Toolbox is a collection of open source
Python methods for extracting and visualizing data from Apple Messages. The
toolbox includes code to convert the Messages application&rsquo;s SQLite chat
database to a pandas DataFrame object as well as convenient methods for
visualizing the chat data with resampled time series, pie charts, and
temporal heatmaps. The code also exports chat dialogues as styled HTML
documents for more convenient searching and previewing.</p><a class=button target=_blank href=https://github.com/parkersruth/amat>Code</a><h1 id=amorphous-computing>Amorphous Computing</h1><div class=wrapper><div class=h_iframe><img class=ratio src=/img/placeholder16x9.png>

individually limited capacity can collectively and asynchronously perform
emergent global computations. Building better tools for designing amorphous
algorithms can have implications for swarm robotics, grid computing, and
synthetic biology, among other fields.
Inspired by amorphous computing literature, this project presents Pinguin,
an amorphous computing simulator and development environment. I designed a
domain-specific language called Ping and implemented a source-to-source
compiler into JavaScript to make amorphous code editable in a web browser.
The user can interact with the amorphous simulation as it updates thousands
of cells at 60 frames per second. I also wrote and produced an educational
video to raise awareness of this topic.</p><a class=button target=_blank href=https://parkersruth.com/amorphous>Website</a><h1 id=paper-cup-construction>Paper Cup Construction</h1><div class=wrapper><div class=h_iframe><img class=ratio src=/img/placeholder16x9.png>

visual-spatial reasoning, mathematical and problem solving abilities,
language acquisition, social skills, and creativity. Paper cups are an ideal
play medium, striking a unique balance of artistic flexibility and physical
problem solving. The creative, stimulating, and collaborative aspects of
paper cup construction make it an exemplary educational activity. Paper cups
are extremely affordable, safe, storable, and surprisingly durable. In an
age of electronics and marketing hype, paper cups are refreshingly simple,
in keeping with research findings that the simplest toys can often be the
most intellectually stimulating. Because early play with simple constructive
toys has been correlated with later academic success, paper cups provide
families and schools with a low-cost, creative, cooperative activity. They
are also perfect for professional team building or icebreaker activities.</p><p>To promote the concept of paper cup construction, I produced a short video,
created a website, compiled a technical report, and published a book on the
topic. I periodically host paper cup construction activities at local
educational venues. This project was recognized as an honorable mention in
the <a href=https://www.davidsongifted.org/Fellows-Scholarship>Davidson Fellows Scholarship</a>.</p><p><a class=button target=_blank href=http://papercupconstruction.com>Website</a>

resources, and environment for students to develop an interest in physics
and explore it for fun. I launched this initiative to promote interest in
physics by providing conceptual introductions to modern physics topics. I
wrote, filmed, animated, and published a series of seven 15-minute
educational videos on topics ranging from antimatter to black holes. I
presented this work at the 2016 annual meeting of the Pacific Northwest
Association for College Physics.</p><a class=button target=_blank href=http://quantumspotacademy.org>Website</a></main><footer>&copy; 2021 Parker Ruth<br></footer></body></html>
